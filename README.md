# Codecademy_Fotomatic
This project was made from a Codecademy lesson. Incomplete code was provided for a website called Fotomatic, a fictitious camera company. This goal is to format the website according to provided design specs, make it more accessible based on ARIA roles and rules, and to turn the site into a responsive design.
